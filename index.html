      <p>Computer programming or coding is the composition of sequences of instructions, 
        called programs, that computers can follow to perform tasks. It involves 
        designing and implementing algorithms, step-by-step specifications of procedures, 
        by writing code in one or more programming languages. Programmers typically use 
        high-level programming languages that are more easily intelligible to humans than 
         code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. Proficient programming 
         usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the 
         application domain, details of programming languages and generic code libraries, 
         specialized algorithms, and formal logic. </p>
      <p>Auxiliary tasks accompanying and related to programming include analyzing requirements, 
        testing, debugging (investigating and fixing problems), implementation of build systems, 
        and management of derived artifacts, such as programs' machine code. While these are sometimes 
        considered programming, often the term software development is used for this larger overall 
        process – with the terms programming, implementation, and coding reserved for the writing and 
        editing of code per se. Sometimes software development is known as software engineering, 
        especially when it employs formal methods or follows an engineering design process. </p>

      <header class="main-header-text">Programming Languages</header>
      <p>At its core, a programming language is a set of instructions that enables humans to communicate 
        with computers—using a series of symbols that serve as a bridge that allows humans to turn our 
        ideas into instructions computers can understand. Like spoken languages, each language has its own 
        unique syntax, structure, vocabulary, and even slang or shortcuts.</p>
      <p>In the vast digital landscape, programming languages are the “lingua francas” of software development, 
        facilitating global conversations between machines and developers, wherever they may be. Their importance 
        extends far beyond lines of code—they empower us to use technology to innovate, automate, and bring our 
        imagination to life. If you've ever wondered how your favorite apps, websites, or software come to life, 
        you're in the right place. In this article, we'll explore the not-so-basic basics of programming languages, 
        their pivotal role in software development, and how they shape the technological landscape we navigate daily.</p>

      <header class="main-header-text" id="C_Programming">C Programming</header>
      <p>C is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie 
        and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the 
        capabilities of the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems code 
        (especially in kernels), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application 
        software has been decreasing. C is commonly used on computer architectures that range from 
        the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.</p>
      <code>
        #include <stdio.h>
          
          int main() {
            printf("Hello World!");
            return 0;
          }
      </code>

      <header class="main-header-text" id="Java">Java</header>
      <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have 
        as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended 
        to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on 
        all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically 
        compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying 
        computer architecture. Although its syntax is similar to that of C and C++, the Java language has 
        fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities 
        (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional 
        compiled languages.</p>
      <code>
        public class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello World");
          }
        }
      </code>

      <header class="main-header-text" id="JavaScript">JavaScript</header>
      <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
         It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, 
         supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces 
         (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM). 
         Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some 
         servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.</p>
      <code>console.log("Hello World");</code>

      <header class="main-header-text" id="Python">Python</header>
      <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. 
        Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of 
        significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. 
        It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), 
        object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" 
        language due to its comprehensive standard library. Guido van Rossum began working 
        on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released 
        it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008, 
        was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, 
        released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2. Python consistently ranks as one of the most 
        popular programming languages, and has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.
        </p>
      <code>print("Hello World")</code>

      <header class="main-header-text" id="C_Sharp">C#</header>
      <p>C# is a general-purpose high-level programming 
        language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing,
        strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic,
        object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming 
        disciplines. The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg 
        from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by 
        Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270 and 20619) in 2003. 
        Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which 
        were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years 
        later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a 
        cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. 
        A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), 
        and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, 
        open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.</p>
      <code>using System;

        namespace HelloWorld
        {
          class Program
          {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
              Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");    
            }
          }
        }</code>

      <header class="main-header-text">Frontend vs. Backend</header>
      <p>Front-end development is all about designing the surface level of applications 
        by changing their style and appearance to meet the needs of the user or customer. 
        To put it simply, the front end manages the parts of websites and applications that 
        users actually see and interact with to perform certain tasks.</p>
      <p>Back-end development dictates how programs function by creating hidden processes that 
        run behind the scenes. Still, there is a lot more to the back end than just controlling 
        the overall functionality of an app or a website. It also details what happens on the 
        server and database.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="main-section" id="Object-Oriented_Programming">
      <header class="main-header-text">Object-Oriented Programming</header>
      <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the 
        concept of objects, which can contain data and code: data in the form of 
        fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures 
        (often known as methods). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out 
        of objects that interact with one another. Many of the most widely used programming 
        languages (such as C++, Java, Python, etc.) are multi-paradigm and they support 
        object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination 
        with imperative programming, procedural programming and functional programming. 
        Significant object-oriented languages include Ada, ActionScript, C++, Common Lisp, 
        C#, Dart, Eiffel, Fortran 2003, Haxe, Java, Kotlin, Logo, MATLAB, Objective-C, 
        Object Pascal, Perl, PHP, Python, R, Raku, Ruby, Scala, SIMSCRIPT, Simula, Smalltalk, 
        Swift, Vala and Visual Basic.NET.</p>
